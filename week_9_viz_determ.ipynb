    "\n",
    "Data visualization is a key part of exploratory data analysis (EDA), a crucial initial step for understanding a dataset and preparing for statistical modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Helps visually answer questions such as:\n",
    "- what patterns are evident in the data?\n",
    "- what variables are important?\n",
    "- does the data have anomalies or outliers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data visualization is also used throughout the data analysis process to show results and convey information to stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, EDA uses `histograms` & `box plots` to visualize `distribution` of a single continuous variable. `Bar charts` & `scatterplots` are used for `bivariate analysis` - correlation between two variables.\n"

    "The pandas `plot()` method is a wrapper for matplotlib's pyplot.plot() and produces the same plots, but with simpler syntax for visualizing dataframes.\n",
    "`.plot()` has several optional parameters. Most notably, the `kind` parameter  determines which kind of plot you’ll create (default is a `line` plot):\n",

    "### Plotting with seaborn\n",
    "\n",
    "Seaborn is a library for making statistical graphics in Python. It builds on top of matplotlib and integrates closely with pandas data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seaborn not only makes it easier than pandas to prepare a wider variety of plots, but supports enhancements for presentation-quality plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seaborn supports several key types of plots:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **relational** - show the relationship between two numeric variables. Includes scatter plots and line plots\n",
    "- **categorical** - compare data in different categories\n",
    "- **distribution** - examine how numeric data is distributed across a range of values. Types of distribution plots are histogram, kernel density estimate (KDE) plot, and empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) plot\n",
    "- **predictive** - plots that are designed for predictive analysis, such as for linear regression models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Seaborn styles\n",
    "\n",
    "`set_style(style)`\n",
    "Sets the background style with one of these values: `darkgrid`, `whitegrid`, `dark`, `white`, and `ticks` (the default). This style stays in effect until it is changed by another set_style() call.\n",
    "#### General vs. specific methods\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create Seaborn plots using the general `relplot()` command, which expects a `kind` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can use a specific method - e.g. `lineplot()`, which does not require a `kind` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two approaches mostly produce the same result, but the the general methods let you create plots with subplots, while the specific methods don’t.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the general methods return a `FacetGrid` object that contains an `Axes` object for each subplot. The specific methods return an `Axes` object."

    "- palette -  color pallette for the plot\n",
    "- height - The height of the plot in inches with a default of 5. (general plots only)\n",
    "- aspect - the ratio of width to height (general plots only)\n",
